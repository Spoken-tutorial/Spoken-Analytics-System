# Spoken-Analytics-System

## Setting up the project
* Create a virtual environment in recently created directory and activate it:
```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate ( for linux )
```

* Clone the repository and enter to the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Spoken-tutorial/Spoken-Analytics-System.git
cd Spoken-Analytics-System
```

* Switch to branch "arish"
```
git checkout arish
```


* Next, install the dependencies using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt 
```

* Change analytics_system/config.py-exp to analytics_system/config.py and change the configuration of databases

* Restore the mongo dump
```
mongorestore --db logs --verbose \path\dump\<dumpfolder>
```

* Make migrations and migrate the database
```
python3 manage.py makemigraions
python3 manage.py migrate --database=default
```

* Go to file in env/lib/python3.6/site-packages/djongo/models/fields.py and change the line no 91 to
```
for field in self.model_container._meta._get_fields(reverse = False):
```
(mind the underscores)
This is to be done because there is bug in djongo in latest release.

* After that you have to run temp_daily, temp_weekly, temp_monthly, temp_yearly, temp_calcAvg, temp_eventStats,temp_fossStats and  temp_visitorActivityStats files in the shell so that stats can be calculated. 
```
python3 manage.py shell < temp_daily.py
python3 manage.py shell < temp_weekly.py
...

```

(These files contain the same code as in logsUtil_* files but logsUtil_* files run from celery at regular intervals).

* Finally, youâ€™re ready to start the development server:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
